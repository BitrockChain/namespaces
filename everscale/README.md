This document describes the syntax and structure of the TVM namespace for chains using the TON Virtual Machine.
Currently, TVM is used by such networks as: Everscale, TON, Venom, Gosh.

# Namespace for TVM chains
Networks using TVM do not have a single, commonly accepted standard for identifying chains, so chains will be named according to their generally accepted names. The naming principle is described in CAIP-2.
