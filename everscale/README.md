# Namespace for Everscale chains
The namespace for `Everscale` is based on the official name
of the chain and is the basis for all features
within it.

## Rationale

At the moment, blockchain consists of 2 workchains.
One of them (-1), a so-called masterchain,
is needed for service contracts and validator contracts,
another one (0) is for simple users.

However, by reference networks of basic Everscale
is meaning: mainnet and devnet.

```
everscale:mainnet
everscale:devnet
```
## Governance
The Everscale network is governed by decentralized autonomous organization(DAO).

Ever DAO is currently the main decision-making body
used as a tool to create proposals on the Everscale network.
It sets up development directions for the entire ecosystem
and makes strategic decisions on the products.
Thus, holders of EVER, Everscale's native coin,
get the opportunity to participate in decision-making
on the development of the project.
