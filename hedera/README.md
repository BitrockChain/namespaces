# Namespace for Hedera chains

This namespace encompasses all 4 networks of the Hedera Hashgraph system, which
is centrally governed and currently includes 4 "Networks" that are
heirarchically organized into "Shards", "Realms", and Assets/Addresses.

## Introduction

The prefix `hedera` designates the CAIP-conformant schemata of the Hedera namespace.

## Governance

Note that the 3 CAIPs defined here have also been edited by their author into a
Hedera Improvement Proposal, [HIP-30][], which has been accepted and published
in 2021.  Should the latter be superseded in a future HIP, the informational
encoded here may become out of date; in the case of a conflict, consider the
current body of HIPs canonical for Hedera architecture and consider these CAIPs
a "legacy" addressing system for external consumption.
