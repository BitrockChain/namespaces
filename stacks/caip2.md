# CAIP-2

*For context, see the [CAIP-2][] specification.*

## Rationale

In [CAIP-2][] a general blockchain identification scheme is defined. This is the
implementation of CAIP-2 for Stacks. The chain ID is used as a way to mitigate
replay attacks on different Stacks chains, as it is included in the transaction
encoding. Stacks mainnet runs on bitcoin mainnet and testnet runs on bitcoin
testnet3.

## Syntax

For reference, the format of reference currently specified in SIP-005 is an
unsigned integer in decimal representation. The unsigned integer is represented
as a 32-bit unsigned integer with a maximum value of 2^32-1. 

### Resolution Method

To resolve a blockchain reference for the stacks namespace, make an API call
request to a blockchain node on the route `/v2/info`, the response will contain the
`network_id` field. For example:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "network_id": 1,
  "server_version": "stacks-node 2.05.0.2.0 (develop:4641001+, release build, linux [x86_64])",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Test Cases

This is a list of manually composed examples

```
# Stacks mainnet
stacks:1

# Stacks testnet
stacks:2147483648
```
